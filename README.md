#  HR_Data_Anlysis_With_Deep_Learning

## Problem Statement:
Predict if an employee leaves or stays in the office based on various features:
Features used to predict insuance_charges:
1. satisfaction_level
2. last_evaluation
3. number_project
4. average_montly_hours	
5. time_spend_company
6. Work_accident
7. promotion_last_5years
8. Department
9. salary

We solve this problem using two approaches:
1. Logistic Regression<br>
Model created touches 76% Accuracy after oversampling.

2. Deep Learning(Tensorflow) <br>
Deep learning test accuracy reached 94% with undersampling for balance

## This project touches on following concepts:
i. Deep Learning(Tensorflow)
ii Logistic Regression
